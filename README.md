- Question > Status : if state score has to increase . If the state question onClick of Next btn increases

## pseudocode notes

- //next :

- logic:

  - if not all right answer are checked then don't increase the score

        - check if all the indexes of the checked checkboxes are matching the numbers of the solution[counter]
        - ? push all indexes in an array
        - ? compare the array for strict equality`

    รถ

  - read again the project
  - styles

    - error boxes get border-radius
    - question need a margin-top

  - refactor all let auf const
  - refactor ternary Buttons ?
